# Assignment07

## Introduction
This document will record the steps that I took in performing Assignment07. Briefly, for this first assignment, 
we wrote a python script demonstrating how Pickling and Structured error handling work.  

## Process
After completing tasks 1-2, I started working on this week’s assignment script. Steps 2 and 3 included searching the web for examples
of exception and pickling features. I went through a couple of pages like docs.python.org, programiz.com, and w3schools.com, and they 
reinforced what we learned in this week’s lecture. Once that was completed, I felt prepared to work on this week’s assignment. Initially, 
I wanted to keep things simple and do an example of pickling by writing two variables into a list and then writing these objects into a byte stream. 
Then the error handling would be a separate part where using a try statement combined with an except clause to handle an exception. 
However, I wanted to challenge myself a little bit for this assignment and decided to combine these two functions as much as possible. 

My first step was to work on a function to write and read data in binary format. Using Randal’s example from his notes, I quickly stored the data with 
the pickle.dump method and read the data back with the pickle.load method. (Figure 1)

Next, I started a try statement with an except clause. Like in previous assignments, I created a variable requiring the user’s input to get a value 
for a task. Using an if statement, I started a custom condition to raise an error if a task was not entered. Next, I made a variable requiring the 
user’s input to get a value for a priority and immediately converted it to an integer with the int() function. I knew that any value, not an integer, 
would trigger a ValueError, so there was no need to use a custom condition here. And ended this block of code by creating a list containing both variables 
created before. (Figure 2).

Next, using the except clause, I captured any exceptions caused by the user’s input. This would catch any exception triggered by my custom clause or a 
ValueError. I purposefully kept it broad instead of using a specific exception type, just in case. (Figure 3).

Lastly, I decided to implement a try statement to capture any exceptions potentially caused by the pickle.dump method or pickle.load method such as  IOError
or NameError. (Figure 4)

Summary
This week’s assignment was challenging because it differed from all previous weeks. I thrive when provided with a clear expectation, and when left to figure
out my goal on my own, I tend to overthink a lot. For example, for this week’s assignment, I pictured my code including a loop have a user to re-enter a 
value for the variables if an exception was raised. I spent hours working on this, failing to make it work I decided to go with what I described in this 
document. I have to admit that it was a great learning experience but ultimately understood that I should try to master the fundamentals first before I 
take on my complicated code. Below are the screenshots of the script running both in PyCharm. (Figure 5)
